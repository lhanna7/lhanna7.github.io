    <h2>A little background...</h2>
    <div id="p1">
    <p><br>My name is Lauren Hanna, I am a 24-year-old Market Area Analyst for Ford Motor Credit Company! 
    I was born and raised in Los Angeles until I was recruited by the Villanova Universtiy softball team and moved across the country to Philadelphia as soon as I graduated high school.
    Since I played softball full-time, I never had the opportunity to get a job while in school. I turned instead to the local animal shelter where I could volunteer on my own time and get
    away from campus when it worked with my schedule. I have always had a love for animals, but spending my days at that animal rescue gave me a new dream of opening my own non-kill, 
    non-profit animal shelter! <i>As you can already see from this home page, my website will be all about the animals!</i>

    <h2>Why do I want to be a Software Engineer?</h2>
    <div id="p2">
    <p>The reason I want to become a software engineer stems from my time in college, however, I truly have been interested in following this career path my whole life. I've always been a video
        game nerd, spending as much time as my mom would allow playing every game under the sun. Not just that, but I had taught myself how to go into the game's source code and apply
        mods to enhance the experience without any type of training, it just came naturally and when I got a mod to work I would be absolutely ecstatic! When I got to college and it came time
        to choose my major, I declared to the Computer Science school but my coach revoked my application and told me I wasn't smart enough to handle Computer Science and softball <small>(ouch...)</small>.
        Did I graduate from college and get a fantastic job at Ford Credit that I'm excelling at? <b>Yes.</b> However, I always had a lingering feeling that this career path was chosen <i>for</i> me and not <i>by</i> me. 
        <br>

        When I saw the Learn to Code Academy hit my inbox, I knew this was destined for me. I hope you love poking around my website as much as I loved creating it! &#128512
